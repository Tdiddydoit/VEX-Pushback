General Tips:

Pressing CTR and clicking in vs will allow you to view the function and its argruments in an example in VS code
Just because there are no erros in the IDE does not mean your code will work on the bot so test, or have someone else test
Find other githubs where this stuff has been done already reinventing the wheel will take a while
Make sure to open the folder and not the file when using VS code so your vex libary import works
When coping from V5 to visual studio sometimes extra code will be added at the top so watch for that
Over comment your code others and judges will be veiwing it so try to put it in plain english

Code Tips:

Use MotorGroup(Motor1, Motor2) to pass two motors as one when needed
Controller joystick postion can be passed as a interger in motor power and display or elsewhere
You may have to set a class premade or not into a varaiable then use the dot function to accesss the whole thing
